#A set is an unordered collection of unique items.

#Sets are very useful when you need to eliminate duplicate values
#While the set itself is mutable (you can add or remove items), 
#the elements within a set must be immutable (for example, numbers, strings, or tuples that only contain immutable elements).
#Items cannot be changed, but can be replaced (remove and add)
